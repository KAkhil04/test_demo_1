Hello Team,

Regarding TOOLS-99263,

We conducted a preliminary analysis and found that the containers are restarting without reaching the resource limits. Additionally, there is no indication of node memory pressure.

Could you please review the attached heapdump.hprof file to identify any memory leaks and high memory consumers? We also recommend setting appropriate -Xms and -Xmx values and enabling GC logging to better understand the root cause of the OOMKilled issue.
