I am currently using OpenShift Container Platform version 4.14.16 and I need assistance with permanently ignoring specific compliance check results in OpenShift Compliance.

I have identified certain compliance check results that are not relevant to our environment because we have other controls, such as Gatekeeper, in place. I would like to exclude these checks from future compliance scans. I have attempted to create a ComplianceRemediation resource to ignore these checks, but I need confirmation on the correct procedure and any potential impacts this might have on our compliance reporting.

Could you please provide detailed steps or best practices for permanently ignoring specific compliance check results? Additionally, any documentation or examples would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
