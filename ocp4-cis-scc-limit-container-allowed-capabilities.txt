  Limit Container Capabilities
  Containers should not enable more capabilites than needed as this opens the door for malicious use. To enable only the required capabilities, the appropriate Security Context Constraints (SCCs) should set capabilities as a list in allowedCapabilities.
id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_scc_limit_container_allowed_capabilities
instructions: |-
  Inspect each SCC returned from running the following command:
  $ oc get scc
  Next, examine the outputs of the following commands:
  $ oc describe roles --all-namespaces
  $ oc describe clusterroles
  For any role/clusterrole that reference the
  securitycontextconstraints resource with the resourceNames
  of the SCCs that do not list an explicit allowedCapabilities, examine the
  associated rolebindings to account for the users that are bound to the role.
  Review each SCC and determine that only required capabilities are either
  completely added as a list entry under allowedCapabilities,
  or that all the un-required capabilities are dropped for containers and SCCs.
  varible var_sccs_with_allowed_capabilities_regex can be set to exclude certain
  SCCs from the check.
  Use following command to verify if the correct regex is being used, this ouput
  will list unqualified SCCs:
  $ oc get scc -o json | [.items[] | select(.metadata.name | test("^privileged$|^hostnetwork-v2$|^restricted-v2$|^nonroot-v2$"; "") | not) | select(.allowedCapabilities != null) | .metadata.name]
  ^privileged$|^hostnetwork-v2$|^restricted-v2$|^nonroot-v2$ should be replace to the actual value set,
  either the default one or the one set from TailoredProfile.

rationale: By default, containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned
  by the Container Runtime which can include dangerous or highly privileged capabilities.
  Capabilities should be dropped unless absolutely critical for the container to run
  software as added capabilities that are not required allow for malicious containers
  or attackers.
