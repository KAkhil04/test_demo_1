After reviewing the current memory usage and limits, it appears that there is a significant discrepancy between the allocated limits and the actual usage. Here are the key findings:

Current Limits vs. Actual Usage:

The hard memory limit is set to 60Gi.
Actual memory usage is less than half of the allocated limit, with a maximum usage of 35Gi over the past two weeks.
Mismanagement of Requests and Limits:

There is no shortage of resources; rather, the issue lies in the mismanagement of memory requests and limits.
The deployments have been configured with higher limits than necessary, leading to inefficient resource utilization.
Current Configuration:

The following are the current CPU and memory configurations for the deployments:
Recommendations:

Adjust the memory limits in the manifests to better align with actual usage.
Most of the pods do not require 5Gi to run efficiently. For example, liveperson-deploy is configured to use 10Gi based on replicas but only utilizes 5Gi in total.
By reducing the memory limits, we can ensure more efficient use of available resources and prevent overallocation.
Please review the above findings and consider adjusting the memory limits accordingly to optimize resource usage.
