Using the ocp4-rbac-limit-cluster-admin rule as an example, it is a best practice recommendation:
Review users and groups bound to cluster-admin and decide whether they
  require such access. Consider creating least-privilege roles for users and
  service accounts.
A review of access cannot be passed or failed by a rule. We manage cluster admin access via ADOM/RBAC.
As another example, ocp4-rbac-limit-secrets-access is another best practice.
The Kubernetes API stores secrets, which may be service account tokens
  for the Kubernetes API or credentials used by workloads in the cluster. Access to
  these secrets should be restricted to the smallest possible group of users to reduce
  the risk of privilege escalation. To restrict users from secrets, remove get , list
  , and watch access to unauthorized users to secret objects in the cluster.
We provide two RBAC levels, namespace admin and developer. Admins can manage secrets WITHIN THEIR NAMESPACE ONLY, while developers cannot even see secrets.  So this is managed through ADOM/RBAC just like cluster admin.

they can't fail us on best practices. it's not a check to make sure a setting is valid. it's a recommendation as to how we should conduct business. and i have no problem taking that up with his mgmt if i have to.

- name: ocp4-general-namespaces-in-use
  rationale: This rule is a best practice recommendation and not a mandatory compliance check. We manage namespaces according to our internal policies and procedures.

- name: ocp4-rbac-least-privilege
  rationale: This rule is a best practice recommendation. We manage RBAC through ADOM/RBAC to ensure least-privilege access is maintained.

- name: ocp4-rbac-limit-cluster-admin
  rationale: This rule is a best practice recommendation. We manage cluster admin access via ADOM/RBAC, ensuring that only necessary users and groups have cluster-admin access.

- name: ocp4-rbac-limit-secrets-access
  rationale: This rule is a best practice recommendation. We manage access to secrets through ADOM/RBAC, providing two RBAC levels: namespace admin and developer. Admins can manage secrets within their namespace only, while developers cannot see secrets.

- name: ocp4-accounts-unique-service-account
  rationale: This rule is a best practice recommendation. We manage service accounts according to our internal policies and procedures to ensure unique service accounts are used where necessary.
